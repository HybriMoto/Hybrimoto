        <h2 >About Us</h2>
        <p>
            HybriMoto is a next-generation mobility startup focused on 
            designing and building smart, eco-efficient Hybrid Motorcycles
            from the ground up. Our mission is to deliver a cost-effective, 
            dual-powered two-wheeler that combines the strength of Internal 
            Combustion with the precision of electric mobility â€”perfectly suited 
            for urban and semi-urban consumers in India. We aim to make 
            sustainable transportation both accessible and affordable for 
            everyday riders.

            We are making AWD (All wheel Drive) Hybrid Motorcycle that is powered by 
            Twin motors and an IC engine .Our hybrid vehicle features four distinct 
            operating modes: ICE, EV, Assist, and Smart. A manual switch allows users 
            to seamlessly toggle between ICE, EV, and Assist modes based on driving needs. 
            The Smart mode automatically selects the optimal mode by analyzing driving 
            conditions, ensuring maximum efficiency and performance without driver intervention.

        <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            In the last six years, India's two-wheeler market has seen a steady rebound in ICE (petrol) motorcycle sales, from 13.6 million in Fiscal Year 2021 owing to the pandemic to approximately 19.6 million in Fiscal Year 2025. Meanwhile, EV two-wheeler sales increased from 28,000 units in Fiscal Year 2019 to over 1.1 million units in Fiscal Year 2024, representing a 33-fold increase and roughly a sixth of the market. This rapid growth of EVs, along with the persistent dominance of gasoline vehicles, suggests a big opportunity for hybrid bikes to close the performance-efficiency gap.
